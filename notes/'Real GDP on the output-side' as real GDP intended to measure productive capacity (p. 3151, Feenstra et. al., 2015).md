Feenstra et. al. refer to *real GDP on the output-side* as real GDP intended to measure productive capacity. (p. 3151, Feenstra et. al., 2015)

>>Most importantly, we distinguish whether real GDP is intended to measure the standard of living across countries or to measure productive capacity. As argued by Feenstra et al. (2009), real GDP in previous versions of PWT, or its components such as consumption or domestic absorption, was intended to measure the standard of living across countries. They refer to this concept as “real GDP on the expenditure side,” or real $\text{GDP}^{e}$. This variable was close to what is called “command-basis GDP” in the United States. We contrast this concept with “real GDP on the output-side,” or real $\text{GDP}^{o}$ , which is intended to measure the productive capacity of an economy.
