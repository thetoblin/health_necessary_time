Nadeau says that the individual income tax (included in the federal tax[^incl-fed] which is included in their living-wage estimate[^livwageest]) are "after tax credits[^taxcred] including the refundable portion of earned income and child tax credits." (p.6, Nadeau and Glasmeier, 2019)

>>*Taxes*. Estimates for federal and state taxes are included in the calculation of a living wage. Property taxes and sales taxes are already represented in the budget estimates through the cost of rent and other necessities.
>>
>>Federal taxes are taken from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center Microsimulation Model (version 0217-1)\[24] and include: individual income taxes (after tax credits including the refundable portion of earned income and child tax credits), payroll taxes (including both the employee and employer portion of social security and medicare taxes), corporate income tax, estate tax, and excise tax. The federal tax rate for the middle quintile was 14.0% in 2017.
>>
>>The state tax rate is taken from the state income tax rate, as reported by the CCH State Tax Handbook 2015, which reports 2016 tax rates.\[25] The tax rate tier applied is determined by the pre-tax living wage, and includes deductions.\[26]
