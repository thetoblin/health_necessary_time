The Penn World Table 10.0 provides an additional datafile specifying the sources and methods for compiling employment, educational attainment and labor share data.

The original datafile is in .dta file format (that has to be opened with a software called Stata). I have converted the file from .dta to .csv using the Python pandas package.
